# Calendar generator
JavaFX program to generate repeating calendar events in the iCalendar format for importing into various calendar software. It has been tested with the Google Calendar and is primarily developed for it.

# Planned features
 * In-program help for all form fields
 * Transparency selection (being (un)available during an event)
 * Better GUI appearance

# Debug mode
One can enter the debug mode by passing the 'debug' argument to the program. This enables printing of extra information into the console which can aid in finding the cause of a problem.
